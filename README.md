# ClientCSD
CSDProjectClient

Client part of the project done for University for the Dependable Distributed Systems class. This part was on my personal pc and was not uploaded at the same time of the rest of the project in early 2023.

Description:  The application logic protocol will be responsible for two primary tasks: i) interactions with clients, receiving their operations and replying to them to confirm that those operations where received and will be processed; and ii) maintaining state about current offers and requests, and matches that might be executed among them, this will also require that the application logic exposes operations to clients that allow them to gather information (asynchronously) about the state of their current made (and confirmed) offers and requests for goods. The application will have to submit operations received by the clients to the blockchain protocol, such that these operations can be registered in the replicated ledger (and potentially be matched).
